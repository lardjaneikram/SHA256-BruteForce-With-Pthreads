# SHA256-BruteForce-With-Pthreads
Brute-force password cracking tool for SHA-256 hashes implemented in both sequential and parallel versions using Pthreads in C. This educational project demonstrates how multithreading can dramatically reduce execution time in cryptanalysis tasks by distributing the search space among multiple threads.

The project includes:
- sha256_seq.c – Sequential brute-force implementation
- sha256_pthread.c – Parallel brute-force implementation using Pthreads
